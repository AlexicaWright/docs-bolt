= Bolt Protocol 

Bolt is an application protocol for the execution of database queries via a database query language, such as link:https://opencypher.org/[Cypher].
It is generally carried over a regular link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc793[TCP] or link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API[WebSocket] connection.

Bolt inherits its core type system from PackStream, over which its messages are generally carried.
Each version of Bolt provides a number of type system extensions, via the PackStream type extension mechanism.
